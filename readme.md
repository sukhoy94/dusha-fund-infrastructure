## Our goals
Our foundation has its roots in the "My soul is Ukraine" project, which emerged from the desire to promote Ukrainian culture and art in Poland and to build bridges between people from both countries. Since its establishment in February 2024, we have been actively engaged in supporting various artistic and cultural activities. Our goal is not only to promote art but also to propagate values such as diversity, open dialogue between cultures, and the development of local and regional communities. 
We want to create a platform where each individual can pursue their passions and contribute to society. Let's build a community for the future together.
